# Web-Design-Challenge
### Background
Data is more powerful when we share it with others! Let’s take what we’ve learned about HTML and CSS to create a dashboard showing off the analysis we’ve done.

For this homework I created a visualisation dashboard website using sample visualisations similar to a past assignment (Weather Data).

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and functionalities that allow navigation between them. These pages contain the visualisations and their corresponding explanations. I also created a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

### The website consist of 7 pages in total, including:
- A landing page containing:
An explanation of the project. Links to each visualizations page. With a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image takes the user to that visualisation.

- Four visualisation pages, each with:
A descriptive title and heading tag. The plot/visualisation itself for the selected comparison. A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

- A “Comparisons” page that:
Contains all of the visualisations on the same page so they can be visually compared. Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualisations.

- A “Data” page that:
Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualisations. The table is a bootstrap table component.
